-- For shortcut, you can use "r", "<Shift>s", "<Alt>g", "<Ctrl>Left", ...
-- You can also leave a shortcut as an empty string, it will still be registered in the top menu in Xounrnal++ app, just without a shortcut key binding.

-- Note: If your shortcut conflict with default Xournal++ shortcuts, default shortcuts would have higher priority. For exapmle, "<Ctrl>s" is the default shortcut for saving the file, so you could not set "<Ctrl>s" as a shortcut for this plugin.
